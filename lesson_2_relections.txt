### What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git will creat a directory .git (M) to store all the metadata related
to our files (repository) . We do it so we can get git to take monitor
our files in this repository. When we init git all the files inside the
directory that becomes a repository are initially untracked and somehow git
invite us to run the command "git add" on them. Also git status is a helpful
command.


### How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using the stagin are, you make sure to put ony the files that are made change
to, and those changes are related to each other logically so they make sense
as a commit. Always from time to time try the git status command and also
git diff to compare between what on the staging area what have been modifed on
the directory, and also git diff staged to compare the differnces between
the staging area and the and the last commit (latest snapshot of the repository)
