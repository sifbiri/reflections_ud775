What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    Git will creat a directory .git (a hidden one) to store all the metadata related
    to our files (repository) . We do it so we can get git to take monitor
    our files in this repository. When we init git all the files inside the
    directory that becomes a repository are initially untracked and somehow git
    invite us to run the command "git add" on them. Also git status is a helpful
    command.
